## Approach
Planning
The first step was to plan the structure and layout of the portfolio website. I outlined the sections I wanted to include (Home, Services, Portfolio, Contact) and sketched a basic layout.

Design
I chose a clean, modern design with a dark theme to make the content stand out. I selected Google Fonts and Font Awesome Icons to enhance the visual appeal and usability.

Development
I started by creating the HTML structure, followed by styling with CSS. I used Flexbox and CSS Grid to ensure a responsive design. JavaScript was used to add interactive elements like smooth scrolling and form validation.

Testing
I tested the website on different devices and screen sizes to ensure responsiveness and usability. I also checked for cross-browser compatibility.

## Challenges Faced
Responsiveness
Ensuring that the website was fully responsive on all devices was a significant challenge. I overcame this by using media queries and testing the layout on various screen sizes.

Sticky Header
Implementing a sticky header that changes style on scroll required careful handling of CSS and JavaScript. I resolved this by adding event listeners for the scroll event and dynamically updating the header class.

Form Validation
Adding client-side form validation required detailed handling of input fields and error messages. I utilized JavaScript to check for input validity and display appropriate feedback to the user.

Image Optimization
Ensuring that images were optimized for fast loading while maintaining quality was crucial. I used appropriate image formats and sizes to balance performance and aesthetics.
